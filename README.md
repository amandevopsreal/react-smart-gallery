# Search Filter React App

This is a simple React app that implements a search filter functionality using states. The app allows users to search for specific items in a list by typing keywords into a search input field. The list dynamically updates based on the user's search query, displaying only the items that match the search criteria.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/search-filter-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd search-filter-app
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

3. You will see a list of items displayed on the page.

4. Type keywords into the search input field to filter the items. The list will dynamically update to show only the items that match the search query.

## Customization

To customize the list of items and the search filter logic, follow these steps:

1. Open the `src/App.js` file in your preferred code editor.

2. Modify the `items` array in the `App` component's state. Add or remove items as desired. Each item should have a unique `id` and a `name` property.

3. Customize the logic in the `handleSearch` function to implement your desired search filter logic. The current implementation filters items based on the partial match of the search query with the item names.
